# Data analysis for microbial community in mangrove forest

The scripst available here and data generated was used in a recent study: 

Erazo, N.G. and Bowman, J.S., 2021. Sensitivity of the mangrove-estuarine microbial community to aquaculture effluent: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102204

The analysis for this project relied on the contribution of different bioinformatic pipelines, particularly paprica. Here you can find documentation on paprica and tutorials for microbial community structure and metabolic potential: https://github.com/bowmanjeffs/paprica

The paprica output can be very helpful when trying to infer metabolic potential eg. paprica generates pathways and enzyme data. Here we used additional scripts that help us process enzyme data to extract Nitrogen enzymes. Here you can find more information on how to process the paprica output: https://github.com/avishekdutta14/downstream_paprica 

The scripts available here will help to perform 16S data analysis:
Alpha diversity
Ordination analysis
Deseq2 differential microbial abundance
WGCNA network correlation 
Analysis of environmental data
